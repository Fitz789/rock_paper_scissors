# rock_paper_scissors
I created this project as part of my learning with the Odin Project. The goal is to make a rock-paper-scissors game, played through the console, using JavaScript. 

What I have learned:

1. How for loops can work with a function
2. The value of clarifying your logic and writing out pseudocode before attempting code
3. The importance of understanding scope and defining variables in the appropriate places, in the appropriate manner.
