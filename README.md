# rock_paper_scissors
I created this project as part of my learning with the Odin Project. The goal is to make a rock-paper-scissors game, played through the console, using JavaScript.

Note: my first iteration of this project, for the first RPS lesson, was very different from the final product. The first iteration just met the bare-minimum requirements for the assignment. When I came back to it, I decided to put more effort into fixing some of the fine details, and play a little with the display/layout. It took more time, but I learned much more from doing this.

What I have learned:

1. How for loops can work with a function
2. The value of clarifying your logic and writing out pseudocode before attempting code
3. The importance of understanding scope and defining variables in the appropriate places, in the appropriate manner.
4. A better understanding of flexbox, and CSS styles
5. A better understanding of DOM manipulation.

Last note: I'm still figuring out the whole git commit & message thing - so apologies if the commits are inconsistent and/or the messages unclear.
